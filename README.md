# ToyChain: A Simple Java Blockchain Simulation

ToyChain is a basic implementation of blockchain concepts in Java. It includes block creation, SHA-256 hashing, and a proof-of-work mining algorithm based on configurable difficulty. This project demonstrates how blockchains link blocks via cryptographic hashes and how mining works using nonce incrementation to find valid hashes.
